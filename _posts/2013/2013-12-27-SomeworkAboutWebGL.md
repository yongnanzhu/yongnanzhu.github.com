   Half a year ago, I did some work about webgl.This is the website [__WebGL work__](http://younyzhu.github.com), you can have a look.  
------------------------------------------
   __include__:    
*  1.where I learn webgl and how I learn webgl.  
*  2.some work about the presentation of DMRI in browser with webgl.   
Here I just implement:
>  
*  (1) how to parase the specify datefile(.data) of DMRI data.  
*  (2) The simple interaction of the presentation.  
*  (3) You can also load your own data, but the data file format is just(.data) format from [Professor Chen](http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~jichen/davinci_UMBC/Welcome.html)  
*  (4) I also use E-M alogrithm to cluster the fiber into bundles, but the processing of loading data is very slow.  
 
   About the fibers project, it has the default format, and the Loading is very slowly.
