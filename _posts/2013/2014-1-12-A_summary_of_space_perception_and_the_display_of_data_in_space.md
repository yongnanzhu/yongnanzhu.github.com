# A summary of space perception and the display of data in space   

>   This is a book review of  space perception part of `<<Information Visualization:  Perception for design>>`, some ideal from wikipedia, some from [Webvision](http://webvision.med.utah.edu/book/part-viii-gabac-receptors/perception-of-depth/), Thanks for all the people.

##   Depth Cue theory  

*   Monocular static
*   Monocular dynamic
*   Binocular

###   Monocular Static

1.   Linear perspective

  This seems a feeling of geometry of perspective, when we look at the object from a perspective picture with known distance subtends with a smaller and smaller angle. `Perspective Projection` in graphcis is the use of this effect.    
  Here the depth we perceived as  parallel line converage in a point.   
2.   Aerinal perspective 

  This is just like the effect of `distance fog`, Objects far away have lower illuminance contrast and lower saturation, so that we will feel images hazy far away.         
  Here the depth we perceived as Contrast, such as object in forground has high contrast, wheras object in background has low contrast. Difference in contrast will give us depth perception.        
3.   Texture gradient

   This is just like a car drive away, you will feel it becomes very blur. And when it is very near, you will feel clearer.  Fine details on nearby object,wheras not visible on far away object.   
   Here the depth we preceived as nearby clearly.    
4.   Size gradient

   This is just like a car drive away, you will feel it becomes very small. And when it is very near, you will feel bigger.    
   Here the depth we preceived as nearby big.

5.   Occlusion (interposition)`遮挡`  
  
   Once an object overlaps or occludes another, it appears near to the observer. (partial occlusion)     
   Here the depth we perceived as differnet level of occlusion.    
6.   Depth of focus
   The image of both nearby and more distant object becomes blurred. And the focus object with sharp area. This focus effect can separate foreground object from backgorund. This simulate the depth of focus by highlighing information we care while blurring everything we don't care.    
   Here  the depth we preceived as diffent level of blur(defocus blur).

7.   Shape from shading (Light and shading)   

   Light and shading: The way that light falls on an object, reflects off its surface.
   Shading: depicts depth perception in 3D model by varying of darkness.    
Here the depth we perceived as different

8. Cast Shadow

  The shadows that are cast by an object to the plane, and shadows provide a relative height of the object to the plane. And it will stands out the things in a layer of the plane.    
Here the depth we perveived as as diffenent gray-tone of the color, and the height of the object.    

### Monicular Dynamic(Moving picture)

__structure from motion__:       

   1. Motion parallax        
When we are seat in a moving car, and look at the window outside, we will feel the object nearby moves very fastly, while the object far away moves very slowly.    
Here the depth we perceived as relative distance.        
 
   2. Kinect depth effect    
When the object is moving, the 3D structure of the object can be peceived. It is always combined with other effects, such as motion parallas effect.    
Here the depth we perceived is the shape effect of the object.   
   3. Depth from motion
Objects moves towards the observer, the retinal projection of object expands.   
Here we the depth we perceived as size.

###Binocular (Stereopsis)    

Stereopsis is the impression of the depth perceived when a scene is viewed with both binocular vision.    
Binocular disparity: binocular viewing a scene generates two slightly different images, because of the different position of the eyes in the head. This let the brain calculates the depth in the visual scene.  ( Depth perception )   
Stereopsis is not present when viewing a scene with one eye, or view a flat picture of a scene with both eyes. In other worlds, Stereopsis cannot occur monocularly.
