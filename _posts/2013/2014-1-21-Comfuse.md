  I am a little comfused about what I am doing. 
 I spent 3 days to search some related papers, and read them to get information about hatching.
 But I still can not get my goal I set before, and I am not get the information I want. It is frustrating.
 And I do not know what is right. Maybe I am not get the right point now.
 So today I spend some time about thinking it.    
 
 >Question:
 which hatching method is good for perception of brain fiber shape information(orientation, shading, depth)?    
 which hatching method artist prefer to use for better perception?    
 
 Actually, for the first question, There is no paper for applied hatching to brain fiber(I am not find one (from ACM IEEE)  except one of Dr Chen).  So we just attempt to use those methods, but do I really know those
 algorithm with reading? (no). Because I just what to get information about what they did? what information they
 could convey? Actually, with hatching method, they could convey orientation, shading, depth information just told before,
 so I think I should focus on which one in their algorithms convey better information?    
 
 About which hatching method artist prefer to use for better perception of fiber?
 I think maybe we should do a questionaire, and get the suggestion from artist?
