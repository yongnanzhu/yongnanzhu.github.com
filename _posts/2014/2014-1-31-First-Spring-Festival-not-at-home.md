I have been America for about a month. Actually, It is very fast and I feel how time flies. Everything goes fine and the friends here are very helpful and friendly. Especially the Line of Duty always help me. Teachers here are very kindly. And I begin to enter the state of my study(or work) as in China, and I adjust myself to do well.    

Today is Spring Festival in China, there is no firecracks here, there is no crowed people like in China going to the Temples behiend my home, I do not stay with my framily(Sorry to my father, mother, gradmother and relatives). however I also received a lot of blessing from `Wechat`, `QQ`, `WeiBo` this morning.    

Tonight, We make lots of dumplings for dinner, just like the people in North of China for their festivals. Actually, there is no Festival in my hometown just making dumpling as dinner. I think, It is a happy experience. Thanks Everyone here for my first Spring Festival.    

Now I bless:
> 家人身体健康，事事顺心，亲戚朋友，马年吉祥如意。

The later month, I should do:      

+ Finish the Review paper(about the form).      
+ Finish reading the book I want to read everynight.      
+ Try my best to do the NPR-related paper work.
