I received the BS degree in the School of Economics and Management from Inner Mongolia University of Science and Technology (IMUST). From 2012, I begin studying for my masterâ€™s degree in the Department of Computer Science, majoring in computer application technology at Hangzhou Dianzi University. And now I am also a visiting research assistant in the Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at University of Maryland, Baltimore County. My research interests include  scientific  visualization and visual perception, and intelligent interaction methods.
